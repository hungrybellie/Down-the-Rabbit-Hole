## ✍️ Introduction
Our project, Down the Rabbit Hole, seeks to take advantage of the addictiveness of scrolling on the internet to encourage youth to learn more. Down the Rabbit Hole addresses a more recent real-world issue: __Internet Addiction__. Internet Addiction affects users worldwide and can become problematic. For example, with the ease of access to information, one may be at risk of finding and circulating biased information. Similarly, youth are often at risk of interacting with non-educational, hyper-stimulating content for long periods. 
### How it Works
With Down the Rabbit Hole, users may become informed about general topics like History, Literature, Technology and more through web scraping. Our project scrapes the web for articles and web pages related to subtopics of these general topics. A segment of the article, which may have an interesting fact or background information about the subtopic, is displayed for the user. A highlighted word or phrase in this segment will link to a separate article. The user may continue ‘down the rabbit hole’ of information and proceed to the article or end the rabbit hole. Providing the user with this choice allows them to be mindful of the time spent in this rabbit hole and ensures that they may access only content which may interest them.

## 👩‍🏫 Project Philosphy
> The development of this project is for use in the GryphHacks Hackathon 2022. As an all-women coding team, we chose to reevaluate what it means to code. One may assume coding involves long, tedious and challenging tasks, however, our team demonstrates that coding may be creative, original, dynamic and exciting (C.O.D.E).

## 👩‍💻 Features, Skills and Techniques
### Animation and Graphic Design
 - All designs were created using [Procreate software](https://procreate.art/).
 Procreate is an IOS and iPadOS application for digital illustration and graphic editing. The aesthetic of our project was inspired by Disney's Alice in Wonderland. However, to respect their intellectual property, we created our own designs and animations which would parody that of the iconic movie. These designs include the logo, the font size used and the general aesthetic of the project.
### Python
 - This project uses the [Flask web development framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) .
 Flask is a web framework written in Python used to create web applications.
 - We created the user authentication system used in our project, as well as the under-lying databases used for this system.

 You can learn more about this when you see [the Security subheading](https://github.com/Mandy-cyber/Down-The-Rabbit-Hole/blob/main/README.md#security).
 - This project uses [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/), a tool that aided us in web scraping via the use and control of web browsers.
 - This project uses [Beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a python library used to extract data from html files.
 - Error and success messages
 - Navigation
 
### Html
- Image mapping for multiple pages on the websites
- Formatting images and videos
- Hyperlinks
- Forms
### CSS
- Animations
- Cursor Settings
- Text Styling and Formatting
### Security 
Our project uses a user authentication system that allows users to sign up for Down the Rabbit Hole. When signed in, users may save their favourite article segments for access at a later time. 
Users credentials are stored in a database using a private key. User passwords are automatically hashed upon entry in the login form to maintain user security.
### Accessibility 

- In our project's website we used semantic HTML. Semantic HTML is HTML code which describes what it does. This means our HTML code will be easier to read and understand for anyone who wants to view the underlying code. 
- Additionally, our HTML code uses alt tags for each image displayed for better accessibility, in the case the images do not load.
- Our HTML is structured in an order which may be easily read by a screen-reader, making it easy to understand for someone who is visually impaired. For example, we made use of "h1" "h2" etc. tags, ensuring our headers are in descending order, as well as div tags with specific names (ARIA Roles)
  

## 👍 Our experience
From the beginning, we were all extremely excited to participate in this hackathon. The possibilities, brewed by iced coffee and late-night video calls, were endless. Down the Rabbit hole was born on the first day, and we instantly began working on it. We struggled with HTML formatting, image dimensions (a word that makes us shudder) and more as we continued. Similarly, we realized that two days isn't nearly as much time as we thought. 
We were worried about our project meeting the judges' criteria. Our typical thoughts of "real-world issues" ranged from solving world hunger and ending poverty, and we chose an untraditional route. However, our purpose is personal to each of us. We all have experienced the addictiveness of the internet and see how it can affect our peers, family and friends. Thus we classify it as a more modern real-world issue, as we see its effects all around us.

## 🔐License

We were very purposeful in choosing the type of license our project would have - the MIT license. This license allows users to create, modify, and distribute works using our code, for either commercial or private usage. Essentially, making our code open source. The importance of open source code is greatly underestimated (not sure this is the right word lolol), and we strive to not only promote it, but bring more awareness to it. Open source inspires creativity - sounds a lot like C.O.D.E right!
